  description={Proposed BiTE, an end-to-end EEG classification framework integrating multistream synergy, pyramid attention, and bidirectional adaptive convolutions for robust cross-paradigm BCI tasks. Achieved state-of-the-art performance with both within- and cross-subject generalization. Demonstrated computational efficiency across motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigms.},
